# Touchkey ‚å®

#### Modular keyboard written in pure JavaScript.

*Touchkey is still under active development.*

# Usage

Download [touchkey](touchkey.js) and at least the [default layout](layouts/default.js) into your project and load them.

```html
  <!-- Load the librarie -->
  <script src="path/to/touchkey.js"></script>
  <!-- And at least the default layout -->
  <script src="path/to/layouts/default.js"></script>
```

You can open the `demo/index.html` file in a web browser to check a demo.

# Layouts

*Soon.*

# Development

Just clone the repository and you'll be good to go.

# To Do

- Add space, backspace, etc, support (i.e finish default layout).
- Add nice style and animation.
- Make sure keys are still visible when someone has its finger on it (cf. Android/iOS keyboards).
- Support hammer.js and/or other touch events librarie.
- Make sure it works well with requireJS.
